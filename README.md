An open source golf gps app! Own the course!

Far from complete but it is live in the Play Store. There is also an iOS app already created and live in the App Store.
This app will eventually include support for Android Wear and iOS watch as well.

Hopefully there will be enough personal motivation to add swing tracking based on the sensors in the watch or perhaps through an external device.

Feel free to request features. That is why I started making this... All the golf apps I could find didn't have exactly what I was looking for or their bugs took too long to fix...
