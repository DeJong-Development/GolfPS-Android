An open source golf gps app! Own the course!

Far from complete but plan on updating many features as well as add iOS app.
This app will include support for Android Wear and iOS watch as well.

Hopefully there will be enough personal motivation to add swing tracking based on the sensors in the watch or perhaps through an external device.

At the moment, the app is not available in the Google Play Store but I will be opening it up to private Alpha and open Beta testing soon.
Feel free to request features. That is why I started making this... All the golf apps I could find didn't have exactly what I was looking for or their bugs took too long to fix...
